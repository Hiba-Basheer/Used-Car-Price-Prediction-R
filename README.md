# ðŸš— Used Car Price Prediction (R Programming)

This mini project predicts the price of used cars using Multiple Linear Regression in R.  
It was developed during my postgraduate studies in Data Science.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- R Programming
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- Multiple Linear Regression

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
Contains features such as year, fuel type, transmission, and mileage.

## ðŸ’¡ Objective
To build a regression model that improves prediction accuracy over existing systems.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
Achieved improved R-squared and RMSE compared to the baseline model.
